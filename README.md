# Code-Quiz

## Description

This project is a JavaScript beginner's quiz that uses a timer and correct/incorrect answers to generate a score that the user can then store on the site with local storage. 
The motivation behind this project was to practice using event listeners and manipulating the DOM. 
I learned how versatile JavaScript is as a language, being able to manipulate the HTML in the DOM and totally change the layout of the page on a button click.  
I also learned why using "prompt" for user input can be troublesome -- I saved the timer for last on this project, and once I realized that the timer froze when the user was "prompted," I had to go back and redo a lot of my code.  I also learned that Objects can be used for just about anything.

Open the index.html file in a browser, or navigate to https://veis1337.github.io/Code-Quiz.html
Just click "Start the Quiz!" and use your "abcd" keys, or the button inputs at the bottom, to answer the questions as quickly and accurately as you can!  
Your score will be updated with each question, and your correct & incorrect answer counts are shown as well.  When the quiz is done you will have a chance to log your initials and score to the local storage, which can be displayed for you with the "View High Scores" button.
